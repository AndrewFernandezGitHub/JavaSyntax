Types of Variabkes:
Local,Instance,Static.

Local Variables- declared inside a method or block of code are called local variables

Pros-Save Memory
Cons-limited access, cant be accessed outside of methods or block of code where they
are declared

Instance Variables- declared inside a class but outside of a method or block of code

Pros-Instance variables are accessible in all the methods of that class
Cons-they occupy the computers memory for longer as compared to local variables

Static Variables-if instance variables have the static keyword with them, they are
called static variables

Pros-Single memory location for all the objects of that class.
Cons-Can hold only one value for all the objects and stays even longer inside
the memory than instance variables

Access Modifiers

Access Modifiers are keywords in Java that defines from where a certain variable,method
or class, etc can be accessed.

THere are 4 types of access in Java that we can define using 3 keywords
1)Private
2)Protected
3)Public
Types of access are
1-private, 2-protected, 3-public, 4-default(applied when no keyword is used)

Private access (keyword is private):
when we use the private keyword with any of the variables, method or classes these
can only be accessed within that class

Default access applied when we don't use keywords for the variables,methods, or classes
this means these can only be accessed from the same package

protected access (we use the protected class):
when protected access is applied class members(variables,methods,etc) can be accessed
from other packages but only in the classes that participate in inheritance.

Public Access(public keyword):
public means class members and classes can be accessed from anywhere inside that project
