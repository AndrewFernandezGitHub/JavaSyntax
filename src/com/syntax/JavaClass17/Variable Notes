3 types of variables
local,instance, and static

Class Vars{
int age=10;//Instance variable
static double weight=25.5;//static
void method(){
String name="Andrew;//local variable

}

}

Local Variable:
if a variable is defined inside a method or loop or switch or any other block of
code it is called local variable.

Instance Variable:
if a variable is not declared inside a method but it is inside a class then it is called
an instance variable.

Static Variable:
if a variable is not declared inside a method but it is inside a class and it
has static keyword with it then it is called static variable

When to use which type of variable:

Local variables:

Local variables should always be preferred over instance and static variables
why because they occupy the computers' memory for very, very short amount of time
as soon as their purpose is served Java destroys them.

Pros:
save memory

cons:
not accessible outside of methods/block of code

Instance Variable:
when we want to share something in multiple methods of a class and the information is
expected to be different from object to object we should go with instance variables

Pros:
accessible in all the methods of a class

Cons:
occupy the computers' memory for longer than local variables.

Static Variables:
when we know that information will stay same for all the objects of a class we should create a
static variable for that

Pros:
single memory location for all objects of a class
Cons:
stay longer in the memory
