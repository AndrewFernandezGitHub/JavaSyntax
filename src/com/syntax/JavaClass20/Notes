Constructors in Java:
Constructors in java are special block of code similar to methods that initialize
the objects of a class.
Rules:
   1) they don't have return types not even void
   2)Name of the constructor must be same as name of the class.
   3)Constructors can't have non access modifiers like static, final, etc
   4)We can use the access modifiers like public. private, protected with constructors
   5)If we don't write a constructor in a class, a default constructor is provided by compiler
   6)we can have multiple constructors in a class but their number of arguments
   sequence of argument or type of arguments should be different.
   7)if we have multiple constructors then Java decides which constructor to call based
   on the parameters we pass

  This Keyword:
  it is a reserved keyword in java that we can use to refer to instance
  variables methods or constructors
  1)"this" keyword is used to distinguish instance variables with local variables
  2)we can use "this"key word to call the constructor of a class while inside another constructor
  3)we can use "this" keyword to call the methods of the class

  Other Rules:
  1) this() should be the first line inside a constructor(advanced)
  2)this() used with constructors only, cant be used inside methods
