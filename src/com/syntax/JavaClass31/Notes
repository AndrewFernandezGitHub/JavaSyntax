Maps In Java:
Its a data structure that allows us to store key value pairs.
1)Searching is efficient
2)we can use any types of keys like Double String char etc, we are not restricted to int based natural
indexes

There are many types of maps but we will be discussing only four of them
1)HashMap 2)LinkedHashMap 3)TreeMap 4)Hashtable(old)

Retrieval means getting back the data from the daata structure

HASHMAP:
1)HashMap is the fastest one when it comes to inserting and retrieving the data
2)insertion order is not maintained
3)Most widely used map

LinkedHashMap:
1)LinkedHashMap maintains the insertion order
2)Insertion speed is same as HashMap
3)Retrieval is the slowest one

TreeMap:
   1) Data is sorted based on the natural order(increasing in order from a-z0-100 etc,ascending)
    2)Insertion is slowest because of the sorting

HashTable:
is a thread safe data means it can handle multiple insertions and retrievals at the time from multiple
CPU cores but because of thread safety feature it is also very slow
