Abstract classes in Java:
Abstract classes in java are the classes with the abstract key word. we use abstract classes
to achieve abstraction.


Abstraction:
    Is the process of hiding implementation details and only showing the functionality
    to end user.
Benefits:
    1)reduces the complexity
    2)improves the maintainability
    3)can also enforce rules up to a certain limit
Disadvantages:
    1)classes get tightly coupled


class Dog{
String name;
//concrete class
}


public abstract class Phone{
String make;
String model;
static boolean has 5g=true
}
Rules:
Abstract classes can have all the things that regular classes do but we can't create
their objects directly and if a class is inheriting from that class it must either
provide the implementation for the abstract method or it must be declared abstract
1)we can't have final and abstract keywords with a method at the same time
2)we cant have static and abstract keywords with a methods at the same time
3)abstract keyword with fields not allowed

Interface:
Interfaces are also used to achieve abstraction in java
we can create an interface with the keyword interface

interface Human{
public static final int legs=2;
public abstract void walk();
}
