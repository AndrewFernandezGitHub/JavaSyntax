Encapsulation in Java:

Encapsulation is hiding the class variables by making them private and providing them
with getter setter methods.

Benefits:
    Better control over the data and security.
Collections Framework:
Collections framework is a collection of interfaces and classes which have many methods to store and
manipulate the data.
String name;
String name1;
String name2;
String name3;
String name4;
String name5;

String[] names=new String[10]//this will hold 10 names in the arrays

Limitations of the array:
    1)They are fixed in size once we have created an array we can't modify its size
     2)Arrays don't have built-in methods.

Collections
    1)Dynamic in size, can increase and decrease size dynamically
    2)They have builtin methods to manipulate the data.
    3)Collections framework does not work with the primitive data types we
    have to use wrapper classes.
    4)When we convert the primitive data type to non primitive we call it boxing
Boxing:
int num=10;
Integer wrapper=new Integer(num);//boxing
Integer wrapper=num;  //autoboxing

Double d=new Double(25.5);
double num4=d.doubleValue(); //un-boxing
double num5=d; //auto - un-boxing
==========================================
is multiple inheritance is allowed in java no technically but yes if you explain it
as every class is by default multiple inheritance one is the object class which is inehrited by default
and the other class that we write for the object

In Java when we make a class inherit from another class, we are already doing multiple inheritance
because Object class is automatically inherited for all the classes
