Maps in Java:
    Map is an interface that allows us to store the data in key value pairs.

Benefits:
    1)we can store two values inside the maps
    2)Searching is very efficient in maps
Types of Maps:
    1)HashMap 2)LinkedHashMap 3)TreeMap
HashMap:
    1)Insertion order is not maintained(downside)
    2)Insertion and retrieval is fasts(upside)
LinkedHashMap
    1)insertion order is maintained (upside)
    2)insertion speed is same as hashmap but retrieval speed is slowest
TreeMap
    1)Data is sorted in natural order by default
    2)insertion speed is slowest but retrieval speed is better than linkedHashMap but
    slower than HashMap
Rules:
We can't convert a collection to a map for example we can't convert a set to a Map

Map<String,String> students=new Map<>()
student.put("Yaz123""Yazgul");
Set<String>set=new HashSet(students)


To extract the keys we use keyset, to extract values we use value
