Collections Framework in Java:
collection of classes that help us manage and manipulate data in a better way.

1)ArraysList
    -This class has built in methods like add() remove() clear() etc.
    -Dynamic and can adjust their size at run time.

    we use the <>

ArrayList<> arrayList=new ArrayList<>();

Collections frameworks only withs with classes

ArrayList =>name of the class
<> =>diamond operator we specify the data type
Wrapper classes
For each primitive data type, they created a class
byte=>Byte
short=>Short
int=>Integer
double=>Double



8 bits is a byte
understand the size of bytes and integers etc, things will need to be optimized to take less space

why wrapper classes
1)we get built-in methods
2)a lot of frameworks don't support primitives

when to use primitive:
    -when we care about the memory because primitives occupy 4 times less memory as compared
     to wrapper
    -performance

each primitive has a corresponding wrapper (Boolean,Byte,Short,Character,Integer,

When to use Wrapper
when we can about our ease

collections frameworks heavily used in Automation and QA Testing

in a linked list, the houses for data are called nodes
