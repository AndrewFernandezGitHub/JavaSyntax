Set in java:
set is an interface in collections framework which is implemented by many classes for example:
HashSet,LinkedHashSet, and TreeHashSet

developers usually put the name of the set after the name of the class

Properties of Set:
All the Sets don't allow duplicates.

HashSet:
1)HashSet does not maintain the insertion order
2)it is fast in all sets
3)Most widely used Set.

retrieval and insertion are fast

LinkedHasSet:
1)Maintains the insertion order
2)slower than HasSet but faster than TreeSet specially the insertions

insertion is fast, retrieval is slow

TreeSet:
1)Sorts the data in natural order,for number in increasing order
2)it is the slowest when it comes to store the data

con of tree set=slow

use Hash set if you don't care about insertion order or alphabetical order

When to use which type of Set:
1)If we don't care about insertion order and data being sorted always use HashSet
2)if we need the insertion order we(batch 12) dont have much choice we have to use the linked hashset

LinkedHashSet    Vs         TreeHashSet
Insertion is not slow       Slowest Insertion
Retrieval is super slow     slower than HashSet but faster than linkedHashSet

I don't care about insertion order but i care about retrieval speed, which Set should I use?
Hash Set

I care about insertion order but I don't care about retrieval speed which Set should I use?
LinkedHashSet

if i wanted to have sorted data all the time?
TreeSet

======================================================
Maps in Java:
Maps are an object that maps keys to values

Maps store the values in Key-Value pair and each pair is known as an entry

Values in the Map can be duplicate but keys always must be unique

The Map Interface is implemented by different Java classes, such as Hashmap,LinkedHashMap,
TreeMap and HashTable
