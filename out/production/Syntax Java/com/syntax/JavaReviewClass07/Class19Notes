Review Class

What is class in java?
Template,blueprint,logical entity. Variables, fields, methods,

objects can provides state, behavior
Dynamic

User defined methods vs built in methods

Access modifiers allow us to control the visibility of class members
(fields,methods,constructors, etc) and classes itself in Java

There are 4 access levels and there are 3 keywords that we use to define these
access level fourth level is applied when we dont use any access modifier keyword

1)private(keyword is also private)
2)default (nno keyword means default access level)
3)protected(keyword is protected)
4)public(keyword is also public)

Rules:
1)We should always prefer private access modifier for the fields.
Because the fields contain the data and the methods of your class
might use that data to perform some tasks if we dont perform sanity checks
before setting the values to these fields our classes and methods might misbehave
also the access of that data should be restricted so that not every one can
access the datas.

2)We cant use access modifiers with local variables/

Constructors:
Constructors in java allows us to set the values of the fields of a class.
