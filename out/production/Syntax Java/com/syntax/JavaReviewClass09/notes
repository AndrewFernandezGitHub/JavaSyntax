objects, methods, string manipulations(make sure i understand)

When you have a class you can create as many objects as you want

For examples. if we do class Doctor

we want instance variable likes name, lastName, specialty(all objects in the class are instance
variables)every object has its own variables.

a static keyword could be hospital, which includes everything. each doctor would have its own copy
of the instance variables. when you make the changes to each instance objects variables, they
wont affect each other.

WHen we talk about static variable, they can only be accessed through static method

Static has one memory shared among all the instances
static variable shares one memory, if you have 1000 instances sharing a static variable
and you change the static variable in one object, it will change the static variable
for all instances

in this scenario of the doctors and hospitals, we can have methods also use return types

static  method can be created with static key word

make sure to know difference in return type vs non return type
and void vs print

methods must have return type, name, and parameters(behaviors)

class variables and variables have methods

Whenever we have instance variables, every instance or object gets
its own set of variables(parameters)

constructors are needed to initialize the instance variables or object

local variable can not be accessed outside of the methods or block of code
they are initialized in

3 ways to overload a method

for constructors, instead of repeating code for similar parameters
